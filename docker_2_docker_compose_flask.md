## Reference

> - [Adopted from the official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have already installed both Docker Engine and Docker Compose. You donâ€™t need to install Python or Redis, as both are provided by Docker images.

#  1. Set Up

### 1.1 - Create a directory for the project

```bash
mkdir composetest
cd composetest
```

### 1.2 - Create application file `app.py` 

> Create a file called `app.py` in your project directory and paste this in:

```python
import time

import redis
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)


def get_hit_count():
    retries = 5
    while True:
        try:
            return cache.incr('hits')
        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            if retries == 0:
                raise exc
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)


@app.route('/')
def hello():
    count = get_hit_count()
    return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
```

### 1.3 - Create the `requirement.txt` file

> Create another file called requirements.txt in your project directory and paste this in:

```
flask
redis
```

<br>

# 2. Create `Dockerfile`

In this step, you write a Dockerfile that builds a Docker image. The image contains all the dependencies the Python application requires, including Python itself.

> In your project directory, create a file named Dockerfile and paste the following:

```
FROM python:3.7-alpine
WORKDIR /code
ENV FLASK_APP app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST 0.0.0.0
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev linux-headers
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```

This tells Docker to:

- Build an image starting with the Python 3.7 image.
- Set the working directory to `/code`.
- Set environment variables used by the flask command.
- Install gcc so Python packages such as MarkupSafe and SQLAlchemy can compile speedups.
- Copy `requirements.txt` and install the Python dependencies.
- Copy the current directory `.` in the project to the workdir `.` in the image.
- Set the default command for the container to `flask run`.

> Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in your project directory and paste the following:

```
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

<br>

### 4.1 - Build the app with docker compose
> From your project directory, start up your application by running `docker-compose up`.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

- Compose pulls a Redis image, builds an image for your code, and starts the services you defined. In this case, the code is statically copied into the image at build time.

**errors**

> If you run into the following error, try to delete `~/.docker/config.json`
> `ERROR: (gcloud.auth.docker-helper) There was a problem refreshing your current auth tokens: ('invalid_grant: Bad Request', u'{\n  "error": "invalid_grant",\n  "error_description": "Bad Request"\n}')`

### 4.2 - Check the app in browser

- Enter [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) in a browser to see the application running.

### 5.1 - Edit the compose file

Edit `docker-compose.yml` in your project directory to add a bind mount for the web service

```
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    environment:
      FLASK_ENV: development
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

- The new volumes key mounts the project directory (current directory) on the host to /code inside the container, allowing you to modify the code on the fly, without having to rebuild the image. The environment key sets the FLASK_ENV environment variable, which tells flask run to run in development mode and reload the code on change. This mode should only be used in development.

### 6.1 - Stop the app 

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### 6.2 - Rebuild the app
```bash
docker-compose up
```
